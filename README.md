> **Note:** Occasionally, you may encounter difficulties opening the application. This could be attributed to GitHub's API rate limit. If faced with an issue, simply retry after some time. To assist you, I've implemented code that displays the remaining number of requests and the time of the next reset directly in the console for your convenience.
